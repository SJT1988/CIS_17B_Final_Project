## Roles:

## Brainstorm
### Keep in mind we are a larger group. Must have a bigger but still managable scope
* Top Down 2D RPG
* collect to build to fight
* leveling system: gear or point based (decided)
  * stats? skills?
* story based - linear ? optional ?
  * Laura will have a draft
  * nvm - keeping it simple
  * text will be simple, just for tutorial
 * real time combat
 * story
  * what gets the player going?
  * 3 levels - get mcguffin - win game
   * this may also need to be simplified
  * comedy
 

## TODO
* Learn more about SDL -- see what we can do
 * upload to github
* flesh out combat system
* flesh out crafting mechanics
* once we find our focus, assign roles

## End Goal
* ~ 6 weeks to make
